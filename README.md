# Company_Profit_Prediction Project


## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the profit of startups based on various factors such as R&D spend, administration costs, and marketing spend. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict a startup's profit, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the business world.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on 50 startups, including R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and the corresponding profit. The data exploration phase revealed key insights into the relationships between these variables, and the dataset was preprocessed to ensure its suitability for machine learning.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models were implemented to predict startup profits:

- **Linear Regression:** Utilized the linear relationship between features and profit.
- **Random Forest:** Implemented an ensemble learning approach for robust predictions.
- **Support Vector Regression:** Leveraged support vector machines for regression tasks.
- **K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor:** Employed a proximity-based approach for predictions.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Utilized boosting to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. The results were compared to determine the effectiveness of each model in predicting startup profits.

## Visualization

Visualizations were created to illustrate the actual versus predicted values for each model. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of how well the models perform on both the training and testing datasets.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of key findings, insights gained from the models, and potential areas for future improvement. The machine learning models developed in this project can be valuable tools for startup investors and decision-makers seeking to optimize their strategies for higher profits.
